## Overview

**Project Title**:  
Python Socket Client-Server Chat App

**Project Description**:  
A basic Python socket-based program demonstrating a simple client-server architecture. The client sends text messages, and the server receives and responds to them. This foundational project introduces network communication concepts using TCP sockets.

**Project Goals**:  
- Understand how socket communication works in Python  
- Build and test a basic TCP client-server application  
- Set up the development environment and write clean, working code  
- Push code to GitHub and begin sprint progress

## Instructions for Build and Use

**Steps to build and/or run the software:**

1. Clone this repository from GitHub  
2. Open a terminal and run `server.py` to start the server  
3. Open another terminal and run `client.py` to start the client  

**Instructions for using the software:**

1. After running both scripts, type a message in the client terminal  
2. The server will receive the message and send a response  
3. Repeat to send more messages or test different inputs

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Python socket — Low-level networking interface](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)  
* [Real Python – Working with Sockets](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add support for different message types (greeting, time, math operations)  
* [ ] Use JSON format for structured client-server messages  
* [ ] Handle multiple client connections using threading  
* [ ] Add error handling and edge-case testing  
* [ ] Write a code walkthrough video and demonstration
